# Sounds, samples and kits

A track plays one sample. Everything else about its sound is on the track page,
`Space 4`: see **The track page, envelopes and LFOs**.

## Choosing a sample

Press `Space 5` to list WAV files in the project's `samples` folder and under
the folder you ran from. Type to filter, and press `Enter` to put one on the
current track.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `:sample path/kick.wav` | Put one file on this track |
| `:sample path/drums` | Browse a folder |

The browser looks 4 folders deep and lists up to 2000 files.

Samples stay where they are, and the project refers to them, so moving a
file breaks the projects that use it. To gather every sample into one
folder, ready to move or share, save a copy with `:w path`.

Press `;` in a phrase to hear the row. Notes you play while editing and
auditions go through this track's filter, levels and sends.

On the Sound page, `Space 4`, `K` on File chooses a sample too, and `x` clears it.

## Names

`:name BD` names the current track, in place of its number. A name is two
characters and starts with a letter. `:name` on its own clears it.

## Kits

A kit fills tracks in one go. It is a file in `samples/kits`, such as `909.ron`:

```
(
    sounds: [
        (label: "BD", path: "../drums/kick.wav"),
        (label: "CH", path: "../drums/hat.wav"),
        (path: "../drums/fx.wav"),
    ],
)
```

A kit is a list of sounds to choose from, so it adds no tracks of its own. Use one
with `:kit 909`, then `Space 5` on a track lists its sounds first. Choosing one puts
it on this track, and its label becomes the track's name. Paths are relative to the
kit file, or absolute, or start with `~/`.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `:kit` | Choose a kit from `samples/kits` |
| `:kit 909` | Choose sounds from that kit |
| `:kit path/drums.ron` | Choose sounds from a kit file anywhere |
| `:kit 909 all` | Put every sound on tracks from the first, in order |

`all` keeps a track's other settings, leaves later tracks alone, and adds tracks
if it has more sounds than you have. If it replaces a different sample, the
status line says which, and `u` undoes the whole load.
